# Geneos

### an EOS London Hackathon project
### By Albert, Ben, Jay and Jens

We've created a platform where data scientists can purchase subscriptions to genetics and epigenetics data directly from the source through our decentralized marketplace. At the same time, we incentivize users to share their data and help others by allowing them to own this data sharing process and giving them access to relevant medical advances. Weâ€™ve built this using non-fungible tokens to represent each data license and a decentralized marketplace smart contract to on EOS to facilitate the subscriptions to these licenses.

To run:

`./quick_start.sh`

Make sure to have Node.js and Docker installed.
